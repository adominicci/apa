- Export now offers PDF as well as Word. The PDF is built from the same pages
  the Print preview shows you, so what you hand in is what you proofread, and
  it saves straight to the folder you pick without going through the macOS
  print panel.

### Fixed

- Exporting to PDF no longer prints on the wrong paper. The page size now
  travels with the document, so a US Letter essay cannot come out on A4
  because of a Mac's regional settings.
- A PDF export that fails partway can no longer leave a broken file where your
  paper should be. The old file stays untouched until the new one is complete.`;
