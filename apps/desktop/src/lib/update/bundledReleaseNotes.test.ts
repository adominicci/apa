- The buttons, labels and filters around your paper now follow one set of
  rules instead of five. Small labels such as "Journal article", "Uncited"
  or a language tag are one size and one shape everywhere, and colour now
  means only one thing: something needs your attention. A plain grey label
  just tells you what a thing is. Filter buttons in the essay list and the
  library look and behave the same way. The Edit and Delete links in a
  reference row are real buttons now, so they light up when you point at
  them.
- Short questions such as "Delete this reference?" and "Quit without
  saving?" open in a smaller window that fits the question, instead of the
  wide window meant for long forms.`;
